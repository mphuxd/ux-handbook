### What is UI design?
In computation, an interface is a boundary in which two components of a system exchange information. A user interface is a point of interaction between a computer and humans; it includes any number of modalities of interaction (such as graphics, sound, position, movement, etc.) where data is transferred between the user and the computer system. 

So a user interface is the boundary in which a user exchanges information with another component that's part of the computer system. Generally, the goal of user interface design is to produce a user interface that makes it easy, efficient, and enjoyable (user-friendly) to operate a machine in the way which produces the desired result (i.e. maximum usability). 

This generally means that the operator needs to provide minimal input to achieve the desired output, and also that the machine minimizes undesired outputs to the user.

### What’s the difference between UX and UI?
Scope:
UI is limited to the interface
UX is very broad because experiences are influenced by many things and extend beyond the UI. For example, it may examine the context, environment, mindset, and limitations of a user. The UI is just one of those things that may influence their experience. 
They operate on different layers/levels. UX lays the foundation for UI. 
UX -> interaction -> UI
