### What is UI design?

In computation, an interface is a boundary in which two components of a system exchange information. A user interface is a point of interaction between a computer and humans; it includes any number of modalities of interaction (such as graphics, sound, position, movement, etc.) where data is transferred between the user and the computer system.

So a user interface is the boundary in which a user exchanges information with another component that's part of the computer system. Generally, the goal of user interface design is to produce a user interface that makes it easy, efficient, and enjoyable (user-friendly) to operate a machine in the way which produces the desired result (i.e. maximum usability).

This generally means that the operator needs to provide minimal input to achieve the desired output, and also that the machine minimizes undesired outputs to the user.

### What are the components of UI design?

UI components and variants in design and code

- Design tokens
- Typography system
- Color system
- Layout/Grid system
- Icon system

Some components of UI are:

- Visual Hierarchy
- Constrast
- Space
- UI
- Component design
- Grid
- Typography

### What are important design principles for good UI design?

Feedback
Intuitive
Usability
Visual Design
Heuristics

### What’s the difference between UX and UI?

Scope:
UI is limited to the interface
UX is very broad because experiences are influenced by many things and extend beyond the UI. For example, it may examine the context, environment, mindset, and limitations of a user. The UI is just one of those things that may influence their experience.
They operate on different layers/levels. UX lays the foundation for UI.
UX -> interaction -> UI

### What’s a design system? What experiences do you have working with them?

A design system is a collection of assets, guidelines, components, resources as it relates to the user interface. Design systems promote consistency in digital products by serving as the universal truth in which their UI components and patterns are created.

A design system can also be thought of as systems of systems. A design system often contains many subsystems that describe the user interface such as:

- Design tokens
- Typography system
- Color system
- Layout/Grid system
- Icon system

Brad Frost notes an important distinction to make is that design systems only relate to UI, not digital products in general. This is because it puts an undue burden on the design system to account for every aspect of creating a digital product and leads to a lot confusion across an organization.

A good way to put it is "Design systems care about __________ as it pertains to user interfaces."
