### What is UX?

User experience focuses on understanding and dictating the experience people have with a product, company, or service. To understand UX, it can be helpful to understand its origin and history. Engineering and psychology form Humans Factor Engineering (HFE), of which Industrial Design, Product Design, and HCI are subcategories. Under HCI are interaction design, user experience, and UI design. UX is an umbrella term for several related categories such as IA, UI, and UXR.

HCI is about understanding how humans and computers interact whereas UX is about dictating or shaping how people experience something. But because you need to understand how users interact with computers to design good user experiences, UX falls under HCI.

UI design mostly focuses on developing rules, standards, and optimizations in computer interfaces which were derived from the insights in HCI.

### How does UX fit within tech?

UX is a sub-discipline of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) which directly focuses on understanding how humans interact with computers. The role of a UX designer varies from company to company, but generally are involved from the design and development of digital products as advocates for the end user.

### Why is it important to know how to code as a UX designer?

UX is a branch of human-computer interaction. Knowing how to code is an indication of technical understanding of computers. Without understanding computers, you’re missing half of the equation.

Knowing how to code demonstrates a fundamental understanding of the tools needed to implement designs. It's fundamental to understanding the limitations of these tools and creating designs within these limitations.
Additionally, it helps you communicate with engineers and developers through a shared understanding and language.

If you’re not familiar with code, you might suggest designs that aren't possible or technically feasible but unreasonable, creating friction within the team and potentially wasting valuable time.

Additionally, making meaningful contributions is easier if you can just go into the code and make the changes yourself after getting the right approvals. This lets devs focus on the more difficult tasks.


### What are some components of UX?

UX is a very broad field so it encompasses many subfields depending on how you define it. It has a lot of overlap with other disciplines.
The main components of UX are:

- Research
- Information design & architecture
- Content Strategy
- Interaction design
- Emotional Design
- UI design
- Visual design
- Prototyping

### Please define the difference between information architecture, interaction design, usability, and user research.

#### Information architecture

seeks to structure information, content in a methodical, easy to find, scalable way.

#### Interaction Design

#### Usability

#### User Research

#### What’s a user persona?

Profile of a user archetype used to display who the user is to stakeholders.

### What’s a wireframe? Prototype? What are the differences?

Different fidelities. Used for different reasons. Wireframes are used to determine and test the structure of the design and are used earlier in the design process. Prototypes are used to test the visual characteristics and finer details of the design and are used further along the design process. Because prototypes are more detailed, you are often testing more nuanced details such as interactions between web pages, components, and overall look and feel. Also to update stakeholders with the progress.

### What tools are you familiar with? What tools are important for a UX designer?

- Pen & Paper - wireframing & brainstorming
- Figma - Prototyping, component design, design systems.
- https://www.optimalworkshop.com/ - Used for card sorting and other usability tools
- https://www.typeform.com/ - Used for surveys
- https://avocode.com/ - Streamlines design-file handoffs
- https://www.protopie.io/ - Interactive Responsive Prototypes
- https://www.magicbell.com/ - Notifications
- https://www.optimizely.com/ - A/B Testing

### What are some of the differences between designing for desktop and mobile devices?

Obviously with mobile there's less space, so its about determining how to use that space efficiently and effectively. This means deferring information and details to other pages, and focusing on user flows. Also means you’re limited by mobile computing performance, so you have to be aware of how computationally intensive complex interactions and components might be.

In web design, designing for mobile and desktop usually means creating responsive components, so it's not really about designing for either, you have to design for both at the same time so they are compatible on all screens. So when designing for mobile, you have to be aware of how you might shift the layout at higher resolutions and vice versa.

For mobile apps, you should refer to the device guidelines from the manufacturers.

### What are the three most important UX Designer skills?

Kind of a bad question. Soft skills or technical? In general..
Empathy - The ability to understand users, clients.
Ideation - The ability to think creatively and come up with a solution.
Prototyping - The ability to realize your ideas.

### How would you define visual hierarchy?

Order of visual importance
Visual hierarchy is the principle of arranging elements to show their order of importance.
Visual Hierarchy is used to rank design elements and influence in the order you want your users to view them.
Visual hierarchy is the order in which humans process information on a page. It's a system to prioritize elements so that they are easily understood.

### How would you describe the basic philosophies or principles that inform your designs?

It depends on the project. But generally..
Content based design
Appropriate
How do you balance business needs and technical restrictions with good design?
It needs to be negotiated and it really depends on what we’re talking about.
What do you think is the most important factor on a page/wireframe? Why?
On a single page, the content structure/layout to test out the flow

### What are design principles? Why are they important?

They define approaches to design. A design approach is a general philosophy that may or may not include a guide for specific methods. Some are to guide the overall goal of the design. Other approaches are to guide the tendencies of the designer.

Design philosophies are usually for determining design goals. In this sense, design philosophies are fundamental guiding principles that dictate how a designer approaches his/her practice. Attempts to model design thinking have resulted in design processes.

### What is emotional design? How do you emotionalize design?

### In your work, how do you practice universal design?

In theory
Accessibility
Typography
Contrast colors
Also test for variations of color blindness
Universal design also means designing for different cultures
UI compatibility
RTL.LTR text
Dates
Character limits
Colors have different meanings/perception
Ability to change language

### What is your process for deciding which features to add to your product?

Start with research and feedback.
Validate and make sure its necessary or that the users even want it
Discuss with engineers to determine feasibility if necessary, or to get them in the discussion. Build a prototype?
MVP?
Depends on the stage of the project

### How do you validate or conduct usability testing on a design?

Depends on what stage of the design.
Wireframe testing
Task flow analysis
Test designs against user flows
A/B Testing
Watch user perform tasks
Build prototypes

### Which UX tools do you use in your day-to-day work life?

Figma, browsers dev tools, VS Code, analytics
How do you make a product accessible to users with disabilities?
Follow the ARIA accessibility guidelines.
Use tests to determine potential issues.
Gather data, feedback

### After product launch, how do you measure the success of a product?

### What analytical tools, data and KPIs have you used to evaluate your previous designs?

- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- First Input Delay (FID)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Google Analytics
- Bounce rates
- Interactivity
