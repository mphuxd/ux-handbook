### What kind of UX research methods and processes do you use when starting a new project?

The general process is:
- Perform competitive analysis on Existing solutions/competitors?
- Validate idea
- Field Research
- User Interviews
- Market Research
- Talk to stakeholders to understand what they want
- Gather & onboard team

Some research methods involved in UX are:
- Cognitive Task Analysis
- GOMS method
- Field Studies
- User Interviews
- User Personas
- User Journey
- Empathy maps
- Tree Testing
- Card Sorting
- User flows
- Task Analysis


### When you validate a design, what kind of data do you use?

- Qualitative,
- field interviews
- questionnaires

### What’s the difference between qualitative and quantitative data? When should you use them?

Quantitative data are used when a researcher is trying to quantify a problem, or address the "what" or "how many" aspects of a research question. It is data that can either be counted or compared on a numeric scale. For example, it could be the number of first year students at Macalester, or the ratings on a scale of 1-4 of the quality of food served at Cafe Mac. This data is usually gathered using instruments, such as a questionnaire which includes a ratings scale or a thermometer to collect weather data. Statistical analysis software, such as SPSS, is often used to analyze quantitative data.

Qualitative data describes qualities or characteristics. It is collected using questionnaires, interviews, or observation, and frequently appears in narrative form. For example, it could be notes taken during a focus group on the quality of the food at Cafe Mac, or responses from an open-ended questionnaire. Qualitative data may be difficult to precisely measure and analyze. The data may be in the form of descriptive words that can be examined for patterns or meaning, sometimes through the use of coding. Coding allows the researcher to categorize qualitative data to identify themes that correspond with the research questions and to perform quantitative analysis.
