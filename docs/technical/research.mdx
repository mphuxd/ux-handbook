### What is UX Research?

User experience research is a crucial component of the human-centered design process and essential to creating solutions that meet user expectations and delivering value to customers.

User experience (UX) research is the scientific process of collecting and analyzing information to increase our understanding of users' behaviors, needs, and pain points to dictate the user experience.

The goal is to provide product teams with context and perspectives that they can use to make informed decisions and build user-centered products.

### Why is UX research important?

One of the key benefits of incorporating UX research throughout the design and product development process is that it helps you understand user behaviors and make better, more informed decisions.

Research helps you scope out projects and plan the project road-map.
Research helps teams understand where they should be investing their time and how. It’s impossible to work on all parts of a product at once, so research will help you draft a defined scope and product road-map based on customer data.

UX research helps reduce and mitigate the risk of building the wrong thing or building the right thing in the wrong way. Research breaks down the problem so we could rapidly prototype and test ideas.

By speaking to your customers, you will gain a better understanding of what problems are the highest priority and how you might go about solving them.

Remove bias from the user experience design process by challenging assumptions.

Test and validate concepts & ideas early to avoid wasting time or adding features that users don't want or need.

Make informed decisions based on data. UX research provides the data to support and defend your design decisions to stakeholders.

### When do you conduct UX research?

UX Research should be conducted at all stages of the design process; however, it's the most important at the beginning of any project or feature because research provides insights to inform and guide your design. The earlier the research, the more impact the findings will have on your product, and the more money and time you save further down the design process.

### What kind of UX research methods and processes do you use when starting a new project?

The selected methods must be appropriately designed to answer to the research questions while taking in consideration the project timeline, budget, and the amount of synthesis required for that method versus another one. In other words, research methods depend on the research goal, the stage that you’re at in the design process, and the available resources.

Start with clear research goals, define the appropriate research scope. Create a clear research hypothesis. Follow the scientific method. Report your findings.

Some common research objectives are:

- Perform competitive analysis on existing solutions & competitors
- Validate idea
- Market Research
- Talk to stakeholders to understand what they want
- Create a design specification sheet

Some research methods involved in UX are:

- Cognitive Task Analysis
- GOMS method
- Field Studies
- User Interviews
- User Personas
- User Journey
- Empathy maps

### Explain the differences between idea validation, design validation, and design verification.

Idea validation refers to determining whether your idea has any value. Idea validation usually occurs during the initial research phase to determine whether the idea should be further pursued or researched before devoting resources towards its design and development. Idea validation may involve market validation, competitive analysis, engineering feasibility, and determining if the product idea matches the company's goals, brand, vision, or culture.

The following terms are borrowed from the FDA Design Control Regulations to clarify some of the confusion around UX validation.

Design validation is about whether or not you designed the right product. Design validation ensures that the product conforms to the defined user needs and intended uses and shall include testing of production units under actual or simulated use conditions. Design validation is crucial during the design stage to support the design direction and in production to ensure the final product meets the actual user needs and requirements. Design validation usually involves approval from all stakeholders to begin development.

Design verification is about whether you developed the product right. Design verification confirms that the design output, the final product, meets the design input or design specification sheet. Design verification occurs during or after development to verify the product meets the design specifications. In UI design, this can mean checking whether the developed UI component matches specifications in the design files and running and passing all unit tests.

### How do you validate or conduct usability testing on a design?

In design validation, we need to demonstrate that the product meets the user’s needs.

Validation testing would include test cases, test suites, or even clinical trials designed to prove that the product, as built, operates according to the user’s expectations under the conditions where they intend to use it.

Since these tests should be run on production or production equivalent units, design validation tests are often the last tests performed. However, design validation during the design process can help catch potential design flaws and ensure the design is progressing in the right direction.

Some design validation test methods are:

- Cognitive walkthrough
- Heuristic Evaluation
- Usability Lab Studies
- Clickstream Analysis
- Eyetracking

### What’s the difference between qualitative and quantitative data? When should you use them?

Quantitative data are used when a researcher is trying to quantify a problem, or address the "what" or "how many" aspects of a research question. It is data that can either be counted or compared on a numeric scale. This data is usually gathered using instruments, such as a questionnaire which includes a ratings scale or a thermometer to collect weather data. Statistical analysis

Qualitative data describes qualities or characteristics. It is collected using questionnaires, interviews, or observation, and frequently appears in narrative form. Qualitative data may be difficult to precisely measure and analyze. The data may be in the form of descriptive words that can be examined for patterns or meaning, sometimes through the use of coding. Coding allows the researcher to categorize qualitative data to identify themes that correspond with the research questions and to perform quantitative analysis.

### What is generative research? Evaluative research?

Generative research is a research method that “generates” a deep understanding of people’s motivations, pain points, behaviors, and more. The goal of generative research, also known as exploratory or discovery research, is to help you identify a problem statement, frame the relevant problem to be solved, and gather enough evidence to move forward confidently.

Evaluative research, also known as evaluation research or program evaluation, is a type of research you can use to evaluate a product or concept and collect data that helps improve your solution.

### What is the difference between a field study, an ethnographic study, and a contextual inquiry?

Contextual research is essential to understand the thought processes of users and the underlying structure of their activities. Gather insights through contextual methods and use that data to fuel your product development, marketing, and business strategy.

### How do you perform research without users or if you don't have time for research?

- Use Heuristics
- Do literature reviews
- Outsource it

### What are some common UX research pitfalls & mistakes?

- Research is too broad and may lead to unactionable insights.
- Research has bias.
- Not having clear research goals.
- Not selecting the right research methods.
- Not intrepreting the data to correctly synthesize insights.
- Not using the research
- Starting research too late.

### How would you account for bias?

Probing vs. leading. Saying enough to make your participant comfortable, but not so much you derail the research.
