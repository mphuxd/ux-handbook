# Technical Questions Overview

Technical interviews are a part of the hiring process for technical professionals: it's a highly focused and rigorous process that assesses your technical skills, personality, and problem-solving abilities.

The purpose of a technical interview isn't to trick you with riddles, brainteasers, or impossible questions, but rather to see how you tackle real-world problems, such as those you may encounter once you get hired. Technical Interviews are much easier when you know what to expect and have invested time into interview preparation.

Technical questions generally have a definitive answer that theyâ€™re looking for. Be prepared to discuss your approach and explain your reasoning. If necessary, ask for a moment to collect your thoughts. Ask clarifying questions if needed. In case you do not know the answer to a question, tell the interviewer or ask probing questions to learn more which can help guide you to the solution.
