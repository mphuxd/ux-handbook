# About the UX Interview Handbook

## What is UX Interview Handbook?

The UX Interview Handbook is a comprehensive guide to help UX professionals prepare for their interviews. Inspired by similar resources such as the [Front End Interview Handbook](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/) & [Tech Interview Handbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/), this started as a personal resource to help me study and prepare for UX interviews, and is now free & open source to help you effectively prepare for yours too!

It includes more than a hundred real UX <Link to='technical/ux'>technical</Link> and <Link to='behavioral/ux'>behavioral</Link> interview questions and answers—including questions from top tech companies such as <Link to="/behavioral/companies">Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, & Microsoft</Link>, advice on how to nail your <Link to='presentations'>design presentation</Link> and <Link to='technical/general'>whiteboard challenges</Link>, and links to <Link to='resources'>resources</Link> that I've found helpful in advancing my UX skills and keeping up-to-date with the industry.

### The Problem

UX interviews have become more difficult, challenging and intensive. Regardless of how you feel about whiteboard design challenges, portfolio presentations, app reviews, the reality is that these are all increasingly becoming an integral part of UX interviews, and so interview prep work has become key for getting your foot into the UX door.

If UX juniors are able to land an interview, what can they do to increase their chances of receiving an offer? How might we support people trying to prepare for their interviews? If only there was a good definitive, convenient resource that they can rely on to guide them through the entire preparation & interview process...

### The Solution

When I was studying for front-end interviews, I came across so many interview studying guides. But for UX interviews, there were only medium articles or the standard blog post with the same questions repeated over and over. Good resources were hard to find, and even more frustrating to keep track of!

A better, more convenient approach is to have a single, comprehensive guide to help people prepare for their UX interviews step-by-step, from start to finish. But without a reliable resource to prepare for UX interviews, I decided to create my own—and now it's free & open source so you don't have to.
