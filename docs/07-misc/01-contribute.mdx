# How to contribute

Interested in contributing to The UX Handbook? The UX Handbook is free to use for anybody to use as part of their interview preparation. Contributors like you help to make us great, and so we’re glad you’re here. Here’s how you can contribute too.

Contributions are not limited to code. We also encourage feedback, documentation corrections, new designs or illustrations. If you’re looking for something that we don’t have, or you notice something could be improved, you have two options:

- Open an issue for the request. We’ll review the issue and get back to you with next steps. If we decide the request should be part of our pipeline, we’ll add it to our roadmap.

  - The **issue tracker** is the preferred channel for **spelling mistakes, errors or any general feedback**.
  - Please do not derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.

- Begin the work yourself and contribute it back by opening a pull request. We appreciate complete contributions but also works in progress. You’re welcome to open an issue to surface your work and we’ll weigh in and help where we can.
  - Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout the project (spelling, indentation, punctuation etc.).
  - For first time contributers or beginners, follow this guide here!
    https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions.

Regardless of how you choose to contribute, we encourage you to open an issue as early as possible in the process.

Thank you to all the contributers.
