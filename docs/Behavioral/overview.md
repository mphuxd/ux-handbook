# Behavioral Questions Overview
Behavioral interview questions are interview questions that assess your actions and reactions in a given professional setting or situation. They often help employers determine your skills and qualities, such as problem-solving, customer service, critical thinking and communication.

The most effective answers to these questions are structured with the STAR format.

- Situation: Describe a situation in your work experience pertinent to the question.
- Task: What was your task in this situation?
- Action: What action did you take to address the situation?
- Result: What was the outcome of your action?
