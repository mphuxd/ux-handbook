# UX Interview Handbook

<h2>
  Free collection of resources designed to help UX professionals prepare for their interviews.
</h2>

The UX Interview Handbook started as a personal resource to help me study and prepare for UX interviews. Here you'll find dozens of UX related questions, answers, and links to resources that I've found helpful as I explore the world of UX.

I don't consider myself a UX guru, genius, etc — I'm just someone who is passionate about UX and thought this might be helpful for others. So, if I got something wrong, please feel free to correct me or <Link to="/misc/contribute">contribute</Link> by submitting a pull request.

Good luck. 💖
