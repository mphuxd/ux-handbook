# UX Interview Handbook

<h2>
  Free collection of resources designed to help UX professionals prepare for their interviews.
</h2>

The UX Interview Handbook is a comprehensive guide to help UX professionals prepare for their interviews.
Inspired by similar resources such as the [Front End Interview Handbook](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/)
& [Tech Interview Handbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/), this started as a personal resource
to help me study and prepare for UX interviews, and is now free & open source to help you effectively prepare for yours too!

It includes more than a hundred real UX <Link to='technical/ux'>technical</Link> and <Link to='behavioral/ux'>behavioral</Link> interview questions and answersâ€”including questions from top tech companies such as <Link to="/behavioral/companies">Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, & Microsoft</Link>, advice on how to nail your <Link to='presentations'>design presentation</Link> and <Link to='technical/general'>whiteboard challenges</Link>, and links to <Link to='resources'>resources</Link> that I've found helpful in advancing my UX skills and keeping up-to-date with the industry.

This project is open source, so feel free to <Link to="/misc/contribute">contribute</Link> by submitting a pull request or by following the instructions there.

Good luck. ðŸ’–
