# UX Interview Handbook

<h2>
  Free collection of resources designed to help UX professionals prepare for their interviews.
</h2>


The UX Interview Handbook started as a personal resource to help me study and prepare for UX interviews. Here you'll find dozens of UX related questions, answers, and links to resources that I've found helpful as I explore the world of UX.

I don't consider myself a UX guru, genius, etc â€” I'm just someone who is passionate about UX and thought this might be helpful for others. So, if I got something wrong, please feel free to correct me or <Link to="/misc/contribute">contribute</Link> by submitting a pull request.

Good luck. ðŸ’–

<!-- ### Real advice from real experiences
Questions come from a variety of different sources. Some questions were self-reported from their own UX interviews, from my friends who are also in UX, from online articles who share some questions they were asked and from interviewing others. Some were created by me. 

Most of these questions were found from online resources like Glassdoor while others questions were created by me. 

### Open source & free forever
Open source means anyone can contribute. This means all the material inside this handbook is fact-checked, vetted, and corrected by our community, creating the highest-quality content for each other. Best of all, it's going to be free forever.
