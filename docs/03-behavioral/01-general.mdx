# Behavioral Questions

Below are a list of general behavioral interview questions. They aren't necessarily specific to UX, but you should still prepare for them because they'll most likely be part of every interview.

**This section is still a work in progress.**

For another reference on general tech behavioral interview questions and resources, I highly recommend checking out the behavioral interview section of the <a href="https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/behavioral-interview/">Tech Interview Handbook</a>.

### Tell me about yourself

Many interviewers like to start off with this question. You want to make a good first impression, so practice this until you get it right.

You might structure your answer like this:

- Begin by stating your current role and educational background.
- Then you can elaborate on relevant activities, projects you've been involved in after college, at your current role, and outside of work.
- Wrap up with why you're here and what you're looking for.

There are many different ways to answer this question. Some people might talk about their hobbies to be more relatable, others prefer to be more concise. If you have another way to structure your answer that works for you, that's fine. It's just important to have a prepared answer for this question. Your answer should market yourself as best as possible without sounding arrogant.

### Why are you interested in our company?

Hopefully, you're applying to companies you actually want to work for. If you're not particularly interested in the company, try doing some deep research about their industry and you'll eventually find something interesting to get excited about.

- Interest in their industry
- Personal alignment with their company culture and values.
- Might be familiar with their products.
- Personal goals

### Tell me why you will be a good fit for the position.

Keyword is fit.
People who fit in are those who can get along with their colleagues, can get their work done without too many issues, and bring value to the team.

- You might enjoy the environment and the people there.
- You feel like you belong.
- You love what you do and are enthusiastic about getting started.
- Meet qualifications defined in the job posting and feel confident you can handle those duties.
- You know some niche knowledge about the industry, potential challenges, and direction. You may have some specializations.
- You're in a new chapter of your life and looking for something new, fun, and challenging to immerse yourself in.

Remember, you're interviewing companies as much as they are interviewing you. If you don't feel like you'd make a good fit, you could just say that and share some of your concerns. 

### What are your three biggest strengths? Weaknesses?

For your strengths, try frame them in a way that makes it relevant to the position.

For your weaknesses, give real answers, not thinly guised strengths like "I'm too nice, or I'm a perfectionist". These answers may be interpreted as arrogance. Real answers show you're capable of self-reflection and won't be a pain to work with. Give real answers, but follow-up with how you're overcoming them.
