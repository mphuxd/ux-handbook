### What is your design style?

Swiss & Minimalistic. Clean, sharp, simple. Legible. Can be geometric, angular. Mostly Monochromatic. Limited use of color, but when I use it, its saturated, matte color palettes. Elegant. Strict adherence to grids, but not opposed to using complex grids. Crisp photographic images, preferably film grain. Consistent use of negative space. I like using serif fonts, but also enjoy the modern appeal of sans serif fonts. Asymmetrical layouts

### Pick a product, identify a UX design problem, and describe how you would conduct research.

Pick something you're familiar with.
