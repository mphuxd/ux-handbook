# UX Presentations 
UX presentations are an important part of the interviewing process because as an UX professional, you'll likely be asked to give several presentations to communicate research findings, design prototypes, and design decisions to your stakeholders. 


## Know your projects
As part of your preparation you should focus on 2/3 of your projects to deeply master. During your interview, you may be asked to briefly summarize your projects without using your portfolio. In other cases, you might be asked to give a detailed review of your entire portfolio in front of a panel questioning your entire design process and decisions. 

## Prepare to answer
- What business problems did you solve?
- What user problems did you solve?
- What research did you perform?
- What actionable insights did you obtain from your research?
- What were some challenges you faced and how did you overcome them?
- What were some constraints or limitations?
- What if any mistakes did you make?
- Choice of technology & their trade-offs
- Things you would do differently. 

You should be able to defend your design decisions.
