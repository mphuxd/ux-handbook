# UX Interview Handbook

The UX Interview Handbook started as a personal resource to help me study and prepare for UX interviews. Here you'll find dozens of UX related questions, answers, and links to resources that I've found helpful when I first started exploring the world of UX.

I don't consider myself a UX guru, genius, etc â€” I'm just someone who is passionate about UX and thought this might be helpful for others. So, if I got something wrong, please feel free to correct me or contribute by submitting a pull request.

Good luck. ðŸ’–
