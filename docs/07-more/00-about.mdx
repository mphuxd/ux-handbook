# About the UX Interview Handbook

The UX Interview Handbook is a comprehensive guide to help UX professionals prepare for their interviews. It includes more than a hundred real UX <Link to='technical/ux'>technical</Link> and <Link to='behavioral/ux'>behavioral</Link> interview questions and answersâ€”including questions from top tech companies such as <Link to="/behavioral/companies">Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, & Microsoft</Link>, advice on how to nail your <Link to='presentations'>design presentation</Link> and <Link to='technical/general'>whiteboard challenges</Link>, and links to <Link to='resources'>resources</Link> to help you advance your UX skills and keep up-to-date with the industry.

Inspired by similar resources such as the [Front End Interview Handbook](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/) & [Tech Interview Handbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/), this started as a personal resource to help me study and prepare for UX interviews, and is now free & open source to help you effectively prepare for yours too!

## How it began

UX interviews have become more difficult, challenging and intensive. Regardless of how you feel about whiteboard design challenges, portfolio presentations, app reviews, the reality is that these are all increasingly becoming an integral part of UX interviews, and so interview prep work has become key for getting your foot into the UX door.

When I was studying for front-end interviews, I came across so many interview studying guides. But for UX, there were only medium articles or the standard blog post with the same questions repeated over and over. Good resources were hard to find, and even more frustrating to keep track of! Without a convenient resource to help me prepare for my UX interviews, I decided to create my own.
