# Getting Started

Before you start preparing for interviews, you should have a portfolio with projects and case study reports to submit with your application. If you don't have a portfolio, start now. Most companies require a portfolio to be submitted with your application in order to be considered for the role.

Some resources to get you started on your portfolio.

## Understanding the interview process

While there's no standardized interview process, UX design like most tech roles typically involve a multi-stage interviewing process. These generally start with a phone or virtual screening call where they'll assess your basic fundamental knowledge, followed by technical and behavioral interviews. You will be expected to talk about your past design projects â€” it is not uncommon to be asked to present your portfolio to a hiring panel consisting of potential feature colleages.

Example Process:

- Phone/Zoom Screening call
- Technical Interview
- Behavioral Interview
  - App Review
  - Whiteboard/Design Challenges
- Design Presentations
- Offer

Additionally, some companies will ask you whiteboard through mock design exercises, perform an software application review, and present your findings. In any case, your recruiter will work to guide you through this process. If you are selected to move forward, you will eventually meet with a hiring manager to determine whether your values and personality align with the company's values and culture. Throughout this process, the interviewers will be assessing you typically with a competency matrix such as [this.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_FyyO9MIglunY3SKs3YPiNtqI3wOJjrWyUizTH9J8-w/edit#gid=0) Here's another [example.](https://cleo-ai.progressionapp.com/cleo-ai-design/skills)

The entire duration varies from company to company.

## How to use this guide

Follow along and try to answer the questions on your own. I have provided brief, concise answers to questions and listed any references used to answer them. I highly recommend reading the references as they are great resources that go into a lot more detail than I can here. If you are short on time, I indicated what I think are the most important questions with an "\*" in the table of contents.

## How questions were selected

Questions come from a variety of different sources. Most questions were obtained through scrapping UX interview questions on Glassdoor. Some were sourced from my friends who are also in UX, online articles, and forums. Some were created by me.

There's no definitive list of what questions will be asked during interviews. Each interviewer selects their own questions depending on the position and what they're looking for. With adequate preparation however, none of the questions should catch you off-guard.
