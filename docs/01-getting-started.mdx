# Getting Started

Before you start preparing for interviews, you should have a portfolio with a couple projects and case study reports to submit with your application. If you don't have a portfolio or any projects, start now. Most companies now require a portfolio to be submitted with your application in order to be considered for the role.

Some resources to get you started on your portfolio.

## Understanding the interview process

While there's no standardized interview process, UX design like most tech roles typically involve a multi-stage interviewing process. These generally start with a phone or virtual screening call where they'll assess your basic fundamental knowledge, followed by technical and behaviorial interviews. You will be expected to talk about your past design projects â€” it is not uncommon to be asked to present your portfolio to a hiring panel consisting of potential feature colleages. 

Additonally, some companies will ask you whiteboard through mock design exercises and perform an software application review. If you are selected to move forward, you will eventually meet with a hiring manager to determine whether your values and personality align with the company's values and culture. 

The duration of this process varies from company to company. Some people have reported the process from start to finish took around two months. 

## How to use this guide

Follow along and try to answer the questions on your own. I have provided brief, concise answers to questions and listed any references I used to answer them. I highly recommend reading the references as they are great resources that go into a lot more detail than I can here. If you are short on time, I indicated what I think are the most important questions with an "*" in the table of contents.

- Technical Questions - Use this to review or fill gaps in your knowledge.
- Behavioral Questions - Prepare answers for commonly asked scenarios using the STAR method.
- Whiteboard & Design Challenges - Get comfortable creating flows within a time limit.
- Presentations - Prepare to present your previous projects. 

## How questions were selected

Questions come from a variety of different sources. Most questions were obtained by scrapping self-reported UX interview questions on Glassdoor, my friends who are also in UX, online articles and forums. Some were created by me.

Some questions are about specific terminology or obscure knowledge. While these questions may not be asked or even indicative of important skills, it can help point people towards the right direction and deepen their understanding of UX.

There's no definitive list of what questions will be asked during interviews. Each interviewer selects their own questions depending on the position and what they're looking for. With adequate preparation however, none of the questions should catch you off-guard.
