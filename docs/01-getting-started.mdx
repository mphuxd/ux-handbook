# Getting Started

Before you start preparing for interviews, make sure you're actually ready to start interviewing. You should have a portfolio with a couple projects, preferably with case study reports, to submit with your application. If you don't have a portfolio or any projects, start now. Most companies now require a portfolio to be submitted with your application in order to be considered for the role.

Some resources to get you started on your portfolio.

## Understanding the interview process

While there's no standardized interview process, UX design like most tech roles typically involve a multi-stage interviewing process. These generally start with a phone or virtual screening call where they'll assess basic fundamental knowledge, followed by a technical interview and a behavioral interview. You may be asked to present previous design projects or your entire portfolio to a hiring panel consisting of potential feature colleages. Some companies will also have you whiteboard through a mock design exercise. Then, you'll meet with a hiring manager to determine whether your values, personality align with the company's values and culture.

## How to use this guide

Follow along and try to answer the questions on your own. I provide brief, concise answers to questions and list any references I used to answer them. If you want to dig a little deeper, I highly recommend reading the references as they are great resources that go into a lot more detail than I can here.

## How questions were selected
Questions come from a variety of different sources. Some questions were self-reported from their own UX interviews, from my friends who are also in UX, from online articles who share some questions they were asked and from interviewing others. Some were created by me. 

Most of these questions were found from online resources like Glassdoor while others questions were created by me. 

However, there's no definitive list of what questions should be asked during interviews. Each interviewer selects their own questions depending on the position and what they're looking for. 

Some questions are about specific terminology or obscure knowledge. While these questions may not be asked or even indicative of important skills, it can help point people towards the right direction and deepen their understanding of UX.
