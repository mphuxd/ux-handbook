# Getting Started

Before you start preparing for interviews, make sure you're actually ready to start interviewing. You should have a portfolio with a couple projects, preferably with case study reports, to submit with your application. If you don't have a portfolio or any projects, start now. Most companies now require a portfolio to be submitted with your application in order to be considered for the role.

Some online resources to help you get started on your portfolio.

## Understanding the interview process

While there's no standardized interview process, UX design like most tech roles typically involve a multi-stage interviewing process. These generally start with a phone or virtual screening call where they'll assess basic fundamental knowledge, followed by a technical interview and a behavioral interview. You may be asked to present previous design projects or your entire portfolio to a hiring panel consisting of potential feature colleages. Some companies will also have you work through a mock design exercise. Then, you'll meet with a hiring manager to determine whether your values, personality align with the company's values and culture.

## How to use this guide

Follow along and answer the questions on your own. I try to provide brief but concise answers to the questions, but if you find that you need more information, you can read more by clicking on the references. Sometimes I'll ask follow-up questions as thought exercises for you.

## How questions were selected

There's no definitive list of what questions should be asked during interviews. Each interviewer selects their own questions.

Some of these questions are about specific terminology or obscure knowledge. While these questions may not be asked or even indicative of important skills, it can help point people towards the right direction and help solidify, deepen their understanding of UX.
