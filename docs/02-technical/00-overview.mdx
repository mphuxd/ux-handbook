# Technical Questions Overview

Technical interviews are a part of the hiring process for technical professionals: it's a highly focused and rigorous process that assesses your technical skills and problem-solving abilities.

The purpose of a technical interview is to assess test your knowledge in the relevant subject matter. Do you have a strong foundation in UX and the relevant technologies? Technical Interviews are much easier when you know what to expect and have invested time into interview preparation.

Technical questions generally have a definitive answer that theyâ€™re looking for. Be prepared to discuss your approach and explain your reasoning. If necessary, ask for a moment to collect your thoughts. Ask clarifying questions if needed. In case you do not know the answer to a question, tell the interviewer or ask probing questions to learn more which can help guide you to the solution.

Be sure to actually answer the question. You can always follow up with more information, which generally is the case because many times the answer is dependent on circumstances and conditions.
