# Technical Questions Overview

Technical interviews are a part of the hiring process to assess your knowledge in the relevant subject matter. Do you have a strong foundation in UX and the relevant technologies? Technical Interviews are much easier when you know what to expect and have invested time into interview preparation.

Technical questions generally have a correct answer. Be prepared to discuss your answer and explain your reasoning. Ask clarifying questions if needed. In case you do not know the answer to a question, tell the interviewer or ask questions.

Be sure to actually answer the question. You can always follow up with more information, which generally is the case because many times the answer is dependent on circumstances and conditions.
